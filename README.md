# Magenta #

Magenta serves rendered Markdown documents over HTTP.  Instead of generating
HTML pages which would then be served using a separate web server, Magenta
translates Markdown documents on the fly.  The goal of Magenta is to make it
quick and easy to record, view, and share Markdown notes.
